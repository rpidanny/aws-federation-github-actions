# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome, and thanks in advance for your help! Please follow these simple guidelines :+1:

## How to contribute

### When you propose a new feature or bug fix

**Note:** Please make sure to write an issue first and get enough feedback before jumping into a Pull Request!

- Please make sure there is an open issue discussing your contribution
- If there isn't, please open an issue so we can talk about it before you invest time into the implementation
- When creating an issue follow the guide that GitHub shows so we have enough information about your proposal

### When you want to work on an existing issue

**Note:** Please write a quick comment in the corresponding issue and ask if the feature is still relevant and that you want to jump into the implementation.

We will do our best to respond/review/merge your PR according to priority. We hope that you stay engaged with us during this period to insure QA.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Another really useful way to contribute to this project is to review other peoples Pull Requests. Having feedback from multiple people is really helpful and reduces the overall time to make a final decision about the Pull Request.

### Writing / improving documentation

Our documentation lives in the README file. Do you see a typo or other ways to improve it? Feel free to edit it and submit a Pull Request!

## Commit messages

This project uses `semantic-release` to publish GitHub Release and generate [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md). For these to work, it depends on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

As such, when you create a PR, you should make sure your commits follow the convention of: `<type>(optional scope): <description>`.
